    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in\n",
    "which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions)\n",
    "that can be applied to the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition,\n",
    "programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit\n",

    "get started with code. The following webopedia definitions will help you better understand object-oriented\n",
    "programming :\n",
    "\n",
    "Class : A category of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that\n",
    "belong to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object : A self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction : The process of picking out (abstracting) common features of objects and procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation : The process of combining elements to create a new entity. A procedure is a type of\n",
    "encapsulation because it combines a series of computer instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance : A feature that represents the \"is a\" relationship between different classes.\n",

    "### Advantages of Object Oriented Programming :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming\n",
    "techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new\n",
    "type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features\n",
    "from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify.\n",

    "### OOPL - Object Oriented Programming Languages :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An object-oriented programming language (OOPL) is a high-level programming language based on the\n",
    "object-oriented model. To perform object-oriented programming, one needs an object-oriented programming\n",
    "language. Many modern programming languages are object-oriented, however some older programming languages,\n",
    "such as Pascal, do offer object-oriented versions. Examples of object-oriented programming languages include\n",
    "Java, C++ and Smalltalk.\n",

    "developed for educational use at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center in the late 1960s and released\n",

    "technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance\n",
    "cost. The principal advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "· Through inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "· We can built programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another rather than, having\n",
    "to start writing the code from scratch. This leads to saving of development time and higher productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "· The principle of data hiding helps the programmers to built secure program that can’t be invaded by code in\n",
    "other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "· It is possible to have multiple objects to coexist without any interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "· It is possible to map objects in the problem domain to those objects in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "· It is easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "· The data-centered design approach enables us to capture more details of the model in an implementable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "· Object-oriented systems can be easily upgraded from small to large system\n",
    "\n",
    "· Message passing technique for communication between objects make the interface descriptions with external \n",
